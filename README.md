# Coding Questions

My answers to some coding questions asked in tech interviews. These are organized by solution technique.

**NOTE:** *Most of the solutions include unit test with JUnit. If you want the input samples/examples of any coding
question, please review the corresponding unit test in the test folder.*

## Sliding Window

Coding questions that are solved with the sliding window technique:

1. Longest substring with maximum *k* distinct
   characters. ([Solution](app/src/main/java/dev/romantorres/cq/sw/LongestSubstringKDistinct.java)
   and [Unit Tests](app/src/test/java/dev/romantorres/cq/sw/LongestSubstringKDistinctTest.java))
